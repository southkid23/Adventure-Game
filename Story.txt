Story and Notes
------------------------------------------
The game will be adventure based with added mystery. The player will wake up in a room, with no memories of who he is
and what he did before. The player leaves the room and he finds himself outside. Surrounding him is a broken-down village
that seems to be trying to rebuild itself. The player will meet people, search for clues about himself and about the monster
who roams around the village.
------------------------------------------

FIRST ROOM--------------
The player will wake up in a room. In the room is a little girl that tells the player how she dragged him from the outside.
She tells him that there was a recent fire in the village and that she managed to save him. In this room there is an apple,
a butter knife, and a journal. The door leads to outside.

Village Center----------
In the center of the village there is a small well. Next to the well is an old man with a long bear(d?) and a long staff. He
appears to be very wise and very lost. To the south of the center is the small shack from where the player came from. To the
East is a fenced graveyard. To the West is a bank. To the North is a large house.

Bank------
The Bank seemed to be underconstruction due to some unusual damages. You can't go into the bank.

Fenced Graveyard----
{(first time visiting) - vision}
You just had a weird vision about the village being on fire. The villagers were trembling in fear, shouting and trying to get away
from something. I wonder what.

The Graveyard is misty. Some tombs seems to be built fairly recent. In this place there's a shovel, flowers, and a note on one
of the St. Shawn's tomb.
