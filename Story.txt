Story and Notes
------------------------------------------
The game will be adventure based with added mystery. The player will wake up in a room, with no memories of who he is
and what he did before. The player leaves the room and he finds himself outside. Surrounding him is a broken-down village
that seems to be trying to rebuild itself. The player will meet people, search for clues about himself and about the monster
who roams around the village.
------------------------------------------

FIRST ROOM---------------------------------------------------------------------
The player will wake up in a room. In the room is a little girl that tells the player how she dragged him from the outside.
She tells him that there was a recent fire in the village and that she managed to save him. In this room there is an apple,
a butter knife, and a journal. The door leads to outside.

Village Center------------------------------------------------------------------
In the center of the village there is a small well. Next to the well is an old man with a long beard and a long staff. He
appears to be very wise and very lost. To the south of the center is the small shack from where the player came from. To the
East is a fenced graveyard. To the West is a bank. To the North is a large house.

Bank----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Bank seemed to be underconstruction due to some unusual damages. You can't go into the bank because the people constructing
the bank will not let you in. Once you give them the gold you found in the Graveyard, then they will allow you to enter. In the bank
there is a lot of stuff that was burnt from the fire. Weirdly enough, there is a wall that seemed to not be affected by the fire at all.
There appears to be a weird looking hole on the wall. 

After using the brick: The wall opens to some stairs that lead West to the basement. 

In this basement, you see that the giant door of the safe room is open. You go in and explore. You somehow find a golden key.

Fenced Graveyard---------------------------------------------------
{(first time visiting) - vision}
You just had a weird vision about the village being on fire. The villagers were trembling in fear, shouting and trying to get away
from something. I wonder what.

The Graveyard is misty. Some tombs seems to be built fairly recent. In this place there's a shovel, A weird looking brick, flowers, and a note on St. Shawn's tomb.

Note: Greats thing happens to those who shovel

After Shovel: It appears to have a wooden door under those sand.

(Open)

Stairs From St. Shawn's Tomb(Leading kinda Northward)-------------------------------------
A dark and misty room. There are cobwebs everywhere and there is a cold but dusty air. In the room is an old wooden box. In this
wooden box is a talisman with an ancient symbol carved on it. There should also be a bit of gold.

Mansion House(North of the Village Center)---------------------------------------------
The door to the house is locked. Having a key would be the only way in.

After key is used: The House is accesible. The house looks really fancy.  Would look better
if not for the dust that had collected over the months.There's a beautiful backyard at the back of the house. The living room seems to have a weird symbol.
One of the windows seems to be unlocked. 

Once unlocked the player jump out of the window and to be backyard. 
(Vision)
Something that reminds him that this was once his house. and then something something that makes him go back to the starting room to find the secret
about himself.

 For the sake of finishing this stupid
story, you somehow get lead to the backyard.
