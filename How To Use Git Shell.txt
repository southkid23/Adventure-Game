How to Use Git Shell
-----------------------------
1. Open up the Git Shell application and move to the directory you wish to work on.

2. Once you are in that directory, for example like "Adventure-Game", do a
	
	git pull

	command. This updates your local directory on any changes that may have been made by others.

3. Once you are done making some changes and edits yourself, do

	git add -A

	git commit -m "Your Message Here On Any Changes"

	git push
