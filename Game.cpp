Village Center------------------------------------------------------------------
In the center of the village there is a small well. Next to the well is an old man with a long beard and a long staff. He
appears to be very wise and very lost. To the south of the center is the small shack from where the player came from. To the
East is a fenced graveyard. To the West is a bank. To the North is a large house.

Shack
The player will wake up in a room. In the room is a little girl that tells the player how she dragged him from the outside.
She tells him that there was a recent fire in the village and that she managed to save him. In this room there is an apple,
a butter knife, and a journal. The door leads to outside.

Bank----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Bank seemed to be underconstruction due to some unusual damages. You can't go into the bank because the people constructing
the bank will not let you in. Once you give them the gold you found in the Graveyard, then they will allow you to enter. In the bank
there is a lot of stuff that was burnt from the fire. Weirdly enough, there is a wall that seemed to not be affected by the fire at all.
You do something to activate the wall.
